Readme-mono.txt for Contralto v1.2.2:

1. Introduction and Overview
============================

ContrAlto aspires to be a faithful emulation of the Xerox Alto II series of 
pioneering graphical workstations developed at Xerox PARC in 1973.

This document covers installation and use on Unix and Mac OS platforms under
the Mono runtime.  See readme.txt for instructions for Windows platforms.

1.1 What's Emulated
-------------------

ContrAlto currently emulates the following Alto hardware:
   - Alto I and Alto II XM CPU
   - Microcode RAM (in 1K RAM, 1K RAM/2K ROM, or 3K RAM configurations)
   - 256KW of main memory (in 64KW banks)
   - Two Diablo Model 31 or 44 drives
   - Ethernet (encapsulated in UDP datagrams on the host machine)
   - Standard Keyboard/Mouse/Video
   - Alto Keyset (5-key chording keyboard)
   - Audio DAC (used with the Smalltalk Music System)
   - The Orbit raster hardware, Dover Raster Output Scanner and Dover print
     engine, which provides 384dpi print output (currently PDF only)
   - The Trident Disk Controller (TriCon) and up to eight T-80 or T-300 
     drives

1.2 What's Not
--------------

At this time, ContrAlto does not support more exotic hardware such as printers 
or audio using the utility port.

The Audio DAC is technically emulated, but output is not connected to an audio
device on non-Windows platforms at this time.


2.0 Requirements
================

ContrAlto is a .NET application and will run under Mono (http://www.mono-project.com/) 
on Unix and MacOS.

Ensure you have the latest Mono environment installed on your system.  ContrAlto was
developed and tested on 5.0.1 and while it will work on earlier versions, it has not
been well tested on them.  You can find download links and instructions at
http://www.mono-project.com/download/.

Additionally, ContrAlto relies on SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) 2.0 for the Alto's
display, keyboard and mouse.   On Linux, you will want to ensure that the SDL 2.0 libraries 
built for your distribution are installed.  On OS X, the easiest way to get SDL 2.0 is via
Homebrew: (https://brew.sh/), via the "brew install sdl2" command.

A three-button mouse is essential for using most Alto software.  On most mice,
the mousewheel can be clicked to provide the third (middle) button.  Laptops
with trackpads may have configuration options to simulate multiple buttons but
will likely be clumsy to use.


3.0 Getting Started
===================

Installation of ContrAlto on Unix and Mac OS machines is straightforward --
unpack the ContrAlto-Mono.zip archive to a directory on your machine (a
subdirectory of your home directory will work fine).  Ensure you've installed
the prerequisites outlined in Section 2.0 and you should be good to go.


3.1 Starting the Alto
=====================

To launch ContrAlto, run "mono ContrAlto.exe" from a terminal window.  A window 
for the Alto's display labeled "ContrAlto" will appear -- this is where you will 
interact with your virtual Alto.  (Note that on the first run of ContrAlto, it may
take several seconds for this window to appear.)  The terminal window will provide 
you with a command-line console for configuring and controlling the emulated Alto.

On a real Alto, the system is booted by loading a 14" disk pack into the front
of a Diablo 31 drive, waiting for it to spin up for 20 seconds and then
pressing the "Reset" button on the back of the keyboard.

Booting an emulated Alto under ContrAlto is slightly less time-consuming.
To load a disk pack into the virtual Diablo drive, you use the "Load Disk"
command at the console -- this allows selection of the disk image (effectively 
a "virtual disk pack") to be loaded.  Disk images are not included with ContrAlto 
but may be found in various places on the Internet -- see Section 3.1.3 for details.
For example "Load Disk 0 Smalltalk.dsk" will load a disk image named Smalltalk.dsk
into drive 0.

Once the pack has been loaded, you can start the Alto by using the "Start" command
at the console.  The display will turn white and after 5-10 seconds a mouse cursor 
will appear, followed shortly by the banner of the Xerox Alto Executive.  
Congratulations, your Alto is now running!  Click on the display window to start 
interacting with it using the keyboard and mouse (and if you need your mouse back 
for other things, press either "Alt" key on your keyboard.)  See Section 3.1 for 
details on using ContrAlto.


3.1 Using the Alto
==================

3.1.1 Mouse
-----------

ContrAlto uses your computer's mouse to simulate the one the Alto uses.  
In order to accurately simulate the mouse, ContrAlto must "capture" the real 
mouse, which effectively makes your system's mouse exclusive to the ContrAlto 
window.  (If you've ever used virtualization software like VMWare, VirtualBox, 
Virtual PC, or Parallels, you may be familiar with this behavior.)

Clicking on the ContrAlto display window will cause ContrAlto to capture the
mouse.  Once the mouse has been captured, any mouse movements will be reflected
by the Alto's mouse cursor.  While ContrAlto has control of the mouse, you will 
not be able to use the mouse for other programs running on your computer.  To release 
ContrAlto's control, press either "Alt" key (the "Option" key on Macintosh)
on your keyboard.  Mouse movements will return to normal, and you will not be 
able to control the Alto's mouse or keyboard until you click on the ContrAlto 
display window again.

The Alto mouse is a three-button mouse.  Alto mouse buttons are mapped as you
would expect.  If you have a real three-button mouse then this is completely
straightforward.  If you have a two button mouse with a "mousewheel" then
a mousewheel click maps to a click of the Alto's middle mouse button.

If you have a trackpad or other pointing device, using the middle mouse button 
may be more complicated.  See what configuration options your operating system 
and/or drivers provide you for mapping mouse buttons.


3.1.2 Keyboard
--------------

ContrAlto emulates the 61-key Alto II keyboard.  The vast majority of keys
(the alphanumerics and punctuation) work as you would expect them to, but the
Alto has a few special keys, which are described below:

Alto Key       PC Key
--------       ----------
LF             Down Arrow
BS             Backspace
Blank-Top      F1
Blank-Middle   F2
Blank-Bottom   F3
<- (arrow)     Left Arrow
DEL            Del
LOCK           F4

3.1.3 Keyset
------------

A 5-key chording keyboard referred to as the "keyset" was a standard peripheral
in the early days of the Alto.  (It never caught on.)  The 5 keys on the keyset
are mapped to F5-F9 on your keyboard, with F5 corresponding to the leftmost key
and F9 corresponding to the rightmost.


3.1.4 Disk Packs
----------------

A real Alto uses large 14" disk packs for disk storage, each containing
approximately 2.5 megabytes (for Diablo 31) or 5 megabytes (for Diablo 44) of 
data.  ContrAlto uses files, referred to as "disk images" or just "images" 
that contain a bit-for-bit copy of these original packs.  These are a lot 
easier to use with a modern PC.

Disk images can be loaded and unloaded via the "Load Disk" and "Unload Disk" 
commands.  (See Section 5 for details on this and other commands.)

If you modify the contents of a loaded disk (for example creating new files or
deleting existing ones) the changes will be written back out to the disk image
when a new image is loaded or when ContrAlto exits.  For this reason it may be
a good idea to make backups of packs from time to time (just like on the real
machine.)

ContrAlto does not come with any disk images, however an assortment of Alto 
programs can be found on Bitsavers.org, at 
http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/Xerox/Alto/disk_images/.  Images include:

AllGames.dsk    -  A collection of games and toys for the Alto
chm/Bcpl.dsk    -  A set of BCPL development tools
chm/Diags.dsk   -  Diagnostic tools
chm/Bravox.dsk	-  The BravoX word processing environment
chm/Xmsmall.dsk -  Smalltalk-76


3.1.5 Trident Disk Packs
------------------------

Some Altos were used as file or print servers and needed greater storage 
capacity than the Diablo drives could provide.  These Altos used a special 
controller, referred to as the Trident (or TriCon) which could control up to
eight Century (later Xerox) T-80 or T-300 drives with a capacity of 80 or
300 megabytes, respectively.

ContrAlto can emulate a Trident controller and up to eight T-80 or T-300 drives
(in any combination.)  Like the Diablo, the contents of these disk packs are 
stored in image files.  These are loaded, unloaded, or created using the 
"Load Trident," "Unload Trident" commands.  (See Section 5 for
details on this and other commands.)


3.1.5 Startup, Reset and Shutdown
---------------------------------

The system can be started at any time by using the "Start" command, though
in general having a pack image loaded first is a good idea.  Similarly, the
"Reset" command will reset the Alto.

You can shut down the Alto by closing the ContrAlto window or using the
"Quit" console command.  Either will commit disk changes made to the 
currently loaded disks back to the disk image files before exiting.  
However, you will want to be sure the software running on the Alto is ready
to be shutdown first, or else you may lose work or corrupt your disk.


3.2 Additional Reading Materials
----------------------------------

The Bitsavers Alto archive at http://http://bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto is an 
excellent repository of original Alto documentation, here are a few documents to 
get you started:

- The "Alto User's Handbook" is indispensable and contains an overview of the 
  Alto Executive (the OS "shell"), Bravo (great-granddaddy of Microsoft Word) 
  and other utilities.  
  http://bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto/Alto_Users_Handbook_Sep79.pdf
  
- "Alto Subsystems" documents many of the common Alto programs and tools
  ("subsystems" in Alto parlance) in detail.  
  http://bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto/AltoSubsystems_Oct79.pdf

- "Alto Operating System Reference Manual" is useful if you are going to do
  any programming for the Alto.
  http://bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto/AltoSWRef.part1.pdf
  http://bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto/AltoSWRef.part2.pdf

- "BCPL Reference Manual" is definitely required if you are going to do any
  programming on the Alto (in BCPL, anyway...)
  http://bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto/bcpl/AltoBCPLdoc.pdf

- "Bravo Course Outline" is a tutorial that will show you how to use the Bravo
  editor.
  http://bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto/BravoCourse.pdf

- The "Alto Hardware Manual" is fun to read through if you're planning on
  writing an Alto emulator of your own.  If you're into that sort of thing.

4.0 Configuration
=================

ContrAlto can be configured through the use of configuration files.  These
are simple text files with sets of parameters and their values in the form:

  ParameterName = Value

By default, ContrAlto looks for configuration data in a file named
ContrAlto.cfg.  Alternate configuration files can be specified as a 
command-line argument at startup via:
  mono ContrAlto.exe <configuration file>

An example configuration file looks something like:

    # contralto.cfg:
    #
    # This file contains configuration parameters for ContrAlto.
    # All integers are specified in octal.
    #

    # System configuration
    SystemType = TwoKRom
    HostAddress = 42

    # Disk configuration
    Disk0Image = alto.dsk
    Disk1Image = bcpl.dsk

    # Host networking configuration
    HostPacketInterfaceType = UDPEncapsulation
    HostPacketInterfaceName = eth0

    # Emulation Options
    BootAddress = 0
    BootFile = 0
    AlternateBootType = Ethernet

    # Printing options
    EnablePrinting = true
    PrintOutputPath = .
    ReversePageOrder = true


The following parameters are configurable:

SystemType:  Selects the type of Alto system to emulate.  One of:
    - AltoI     : an Alto I, with 64KW memory, 1K ROM, and 1K CRAM
    - OneKRom   : an Alto II XM system with 1K ROM, 1K CRAM
    - TwoKRom   : an Alto II XM system with 2K ROM, 1K CRAM
    - ThreeKRam : an Alto II XM system with 1K ROM, 3K CRAM
    The default is TwoKRom.

HostAddress:  Specifies the Alto's Ethernet address (in octal).  Any value
              between 1 and 376 is allowed.

Drive0Image and Drive1Image:  Specifies a disk image to be loaded into the 
              specified drive.  These parameters are optional.

HostPacketInterfaceType:  Specifies the type of interface to be used on the 
              host for Ethernet emulation.  One of:
    - UDPEncapsulation: Transmits Alto Ethernet packets over UDP broadcasts
    - EthernetEncapsulation: Transmits Alto Ethernet packets over raw Ethernet packets.
            (See Section 4.1 for configuration details)
    - None: No packet encapsulation.

HostPacketInterfaceName:  Specifies the name of the host network interface
              to use for Ethernet emulation.  (e.g. "eth0"")  If no network
              interface is to be used, this parameter can be omitted.

BootAddress: The address to use with a Keyboard Disk Boot (See section 5.0)
BootFile:    The file number to use with a Keyboard Net Boot (again, Section 5.0)
AlternateBootType:  The type of boot to default to (Section 5.0)

EnablePrinting:     Enables or disables printing via the emulated Orbit / Dover interface.

PrintOutputPath:    Specifies the folder that output PDFs are written to. When the Alto 
                    prints a new document, a new PDF file will be created in this
                    directory containing the printer's output.

ReversePageOrder:   Controls the order in which pages are written to the PDF -- due to 
                    the way the original Dover printer worked, most Alto software printed 
                    documents in reverse order (i.e. the last page printed first) so 
                    that the pages didn't have to be reshuffled when picked up from the
                    tray.  By default, setting this to true is probably what you want, 
                    but if your documents come out backwards, set it to false.


4.1 Ethernet Encapsulation Setup
================================

Encapsulation of Alto (3mbit) Ethernet packets in Ethernet broadcasts is supported
on Linux and OS X using libpcap.  While it is tested and works well, it may require some extra
configuration on your system before it will work properly for you.

- Ensure that the latest libpcap libraries are installed.  These should be present by default
  on OS X; on other platforms check your distribution's documentation for details.

- On many systems, libpcap requires additional privileges in order to capture packets.
  You can either run ContrAlto as root, or setuid ContrAlto to root.  Depending on
  your operating system, there may be other options.  See (for example)
  http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap.3pcap.html.

- You may need to modify SharpPcap.dll.config to point to the specific libpcap 
  version you have installed on your system.

5.0 Console Interface
=====================

After startup, you will be at the ContrAlto console prompt (a '>' character).

ContrAlto provides a somewhat-context-sensitive input line.  Press TAB at any
point during input to see possible completions for the command you're entering.

The "show commands" command provides a brief synopsis of available commands,
these are described in greater detail in Section 5.1.

All numeric arguments are specified in Octal by default.  A number may be
prefixed with 'b', 'o', 'd', or 'x' to specify binary, octal, decimal or
hexadecimal, respectively.

All numeric outputs are presented in Octal.

At any point while the emulator is running is running the console is active
and commands may be entered.

Stop Playback - Ends any active script being replayed.

Show Commands - Shows debugger commands and their descriptions.


5.2 Alternate ("keyboard") Boots
--------------------------------

The Alto allowed the specification of alternate boot addresses by holding down
a set of keys on the keyboard while hitting the "reset" switch on the back of
the keyboard.  Since this would be difficult to pull off by hand on the emulator
due to the UI involved, ContrAlto provides a set of console commands to select the
alternate address to boot.  When the "Start With Keyboard Net|Disk Boot" command is
used, the system will be started (or restarted) with these keys held down on
your behalf.

Ethernet booting will only work if another host on the network is providing boot services.

The "Set Keyboard Disk Boot Address" command accepts a 16-bit octal value (from 0 to 177777)
specifying the address to be booted from disk.

The "Set Keyboard Net Boot Address" command accepts a 16-bit octal value (from 0 to 177777)
specifying the file to be net booted.


6.0 Scripting
=============

ContrAlto supports scripting of mouse and keyboard inputs as well as loading and
unloading of disk packs.  Scripts can be recorded live, using the emulator or
they can be handcrafted using a text editor of your choice.


6.1 Recording
-------------

Recording of a new script can be started by using the "Start Recording"
debugger command Recording is only active while the emulated Alto system is running.

During recording, mouse and keyboard inputs are captured, as are the following
actions:
    - Loading, unloading, or creating new disk packs
    - Resetting the emulated Alto
    - Quitting ContrAlto

Recording may be stopped at any time by using the "Stop Recording" debugger command.


6.2 Playback
------------

Playback of an existing script can be started by using the "Start Playback" debugger 
command.  If the emulated Alto is not currently running when a script is played, 
it will be started.

During playback, mouse and keyboard input is disabled.  You can stop playback
at any time via the "Stop Playback" debugger command.


6.3 Script Format
-----------------
The script file format is very very basic; it’s plaintext, one entry per line.  
Each entry is of the form:

[timestamp] [action]

Where [timestamp] is a relative time specified either in nanoseconds (no 
suffix) or milliseconds (‘ms’ suffix).  Additionally, a timestamp specified as
a “-“ (dash) indicates that the action should occur immediately (i.e. at a 
relative timestamp of 0). 

Any line beginning with "#" is a comment to end-of-line.

Each non-comment line specifies an action to take and the time 
(relative to the previous line) to execute it.  The first line’s execution time
is relative to the time at which the script is started.

There are a number of actions which can be specified, these are:

KeyDown [key]: Presses the specified key on the keyboard

KeyUp [key]: Releases the specified key on the keyboard

MouseDown [button]: Presses the specified mouse button (“Left”, “Right”, or “Middle”)

MouseUp [button]: Releases the specified mouse button

MouseMove [dx,dy]: Specifies a relative mouse movement.

MouseMoveAbsolute [x,y]: Specifies an absolute mouse movement.

Command [command string]: Executes the specified ContrAlto command (these are 
    identical to those typed at the debug console -- see Section 5.1), and all
    commands are supported except for those that display status (“show 
    trident disk”, for example).

KeyStroke [key1]...[keyN]: Presses and then releases the specified keys.  
    (e.g. "KeyStroke Ctrl A" will press Ctrl and A simultaneously, then release them.)

Type [string]: Sends keystrokes to type the given ASCII string

TypeLine [string]: as above, but terminates with a CR.

Wait: Waits for the Alto to execute a STARTIO with bit 2 set (in the 
    Xerox bit ordering where MSB is bit 0).  Used to synchronize execution.

Valid values for KeyDown/KeyUp/KeyStroke are:
    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7
    D8 D9 Space Plus Minus Comma Period Semicolon Quote LBracket RBracket
    FSlash BSlash Arrow Lock LShift RShift LF BS DEL ESC TAB CTRL Return
    BlankTop BlankMiddle BlankBottom
